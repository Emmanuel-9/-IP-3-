                    <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the 
                    necessary time needed to understand your product vision.<br> The outcome
                    of this scoping session is either a proposal or a high-level statement 
                    of work.<br> Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete 
                    offering or just the pieces you nedd.</p>
